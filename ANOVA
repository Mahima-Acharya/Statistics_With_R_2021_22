### Exercise 1: Preparation
#######################

library(boot)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(car)

# This time we will be working with the "amis" data frame (package 'boot') that has 
# 8437 rows and 4 columns.

# In a study into the effect that warning signs have on speeding patterns, 
# Cambridgeshire County Council considered 14 pairs of locations. The locations were 
# paired to account for factors such as traffic, volume and type of road. One site in 
# each pair had a sign erected warning of the dangers of speeding and asking drivers 
# to slow down. No action was taken at the second site. Three sets of measurements 
# were taken at each site. 
# Each set of measurements was nominally of the speeds of 100 cars but not all sites 
# have exactly 100 measurements. These speed measurements were taken before the 
# erection of the sign, shortly after the erection of the sign, and again after 
# the sign had been in place for some time.

## a) For the further reference please use ?amis. 
## It may take some time to understand the dataset. 
?amis

## b) Load the dataset, store it into a variable called "data", and briefly inspect it. 
## Feel free to make some plots and calculate some statistics in order to understand 
## the data.

data <- amis
str(data)

ggplot(data, aes(x = speed)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(warning))

## c) All our columns have numeric type. Convert the categorical columns to factors.

data<- data %>%
  mutate(period = factor(period), warning = factor(warning), pair = factor(pair))

## d) Plot boxplots for the distribution of `speed` for each of the `period` values 
## (before, immediately after and after some time). Build 2 plots (each containing 3 
## boxplots) side by side depending on the `warning` variable.
## (For all plots here and below please use ggplot)

ggplot(data, aes(x = speed, fill = period)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(warning))

## e) What can you conclude looking at the plots? What can you say about people's 
## behaviour in different periods: before, immediately after and after some time?

# Looking at the sites where warning sign was erected:
# directly after the warning sign was erected the median speed 
# has gone down but there are the same number of outliers some even more extreme.
# Looking at the period when the sign had been in place for some time 
# we see that the median speed has gone up but that there are fewer outliers.

# Looking at the sites where no warning sign was erected:
# The median speed from period 1 to period 2 hasn't changed.
# The median speed of period 3 is larger than the median speed of period 1 and 2.

# Concluding from this we can say that the effect of a warning sign is very short lived.
# The warning sign slows people only down immediately after it was erected and
# loses it's effect with time.

## f) What are your ideas about why the data with warning==2 (sites where no sign was 
## erected) was collected?

# It was the control group to see what effect no warning signs have 
# compared to warning signs on the speed of cars.

### Exercise 2: 1-way ANOVA
#######################

## a) First let's create a new data frame which will be used for all exercise 2.
## For the 1-way ANOVA we will be working with a subset of `amis` using only the 
## data for sites where warning signs were erected, which corresponds to warning==1. 
## Therefore first subset your data to filter out warning==2 and then apply group_by() and summarize() 
## to average "speed" over each "pair" and "period". 
## Assign this new data frame to the variable casted_data.

casted_data <- amis %>%
  filter(warning == 1) %>%
  group_by(pair, period) %>%
  summarize(average_speed = mean(speed))

casted_data <- casted_data %>%
  mutate(pair = factor(pair), period = factor(period))

## b) Build boxplots of the average speed depending on "period".

ggplot(casted_data, aes(x = average_speed, fill = period)) +
         geom_boxplot()

## c) Looking at the boxplots, is there a difference between the periods?

# Yes, the median speed goes down immediately after erecting the warning sign.
# Some time after erecting the warning sign the median speed got faster than before
# the warning sign got erected.

## d) Now we are ready to perform 1-way ANOVA: please use the function aov() on the 
## speed depending on the period and assign the result to aov1way

aov1way <- aov(casted_data$average_speed ~ casted_data$period)

## Before we interpret the results, let's check the ANOVA assumptions and whether 
## they are violated or not and why.

## e) Independence assumption
## (Figure out the best way to check this assumption and give a detailed justified 
## answer to whether it is violated or not.)

###!!! wrong:
# It is not violated because there are no repeated measures.
# We can check this by looking at the data frame and searching for 
# 2 or more rows that have the same values in the pair and period columns.
# This is not the case here.

## f) Normality of residuals
##  First add the residuals to your casted data set, you find them in model$residuals
##  next, make a qqplot (using qqnorm() or geom_qq() ina ggplot) for the residuals and 
##  run the shapiro wilk test.

casted_data["residuals"] <- aov1way$residuals

qqnorm(aov1way$residuals)
qqline(aov1way$residuals)

shapiro.test(aov1way$residuals)

## g) What do you conclude from your results in f?

# Concluding from the qqplot and the shapiro wilk test (p > 0.05) 
# we can say that the residuals are normally distributed.

## h) Homogeneity of variance of residuals
##  First, plot the residuals by period (boxplots) to see whether variance differs between groups
##  Next, run Levene's test using the function leveneTest() (from library car) with the same syntax
##  as aov(). It indicates whether the variance is significantly different between groups (= not
##  homogeneous).

ggplot(casted_data, aes(x = residuals, fill = period)) +
  geom_boxplot()

leveneTest(casted_data$residuals ~ casted_data$period)

## i) What do you conclude from your results in h?

# The null hypothesis for the Levene Test is homogeneity of variances between groups.
# The p-value is larger than 0.05 and thus we keep the null hypothesis.

## j) Now we turn to the results. Look at the summary of aov1way

summary(aov1way)

## k) State your conclusion

# The p-value (0.382) is larger than 0.05 which means that the speed 
# between the 3 groups is not significantly different.

## l) Please do pairwise t-tests of the same variables as in d) using pairwise.t.test().

pairwise.t.test(casted_data$average_speed, casted_data$period)

## m) Try to use no adjustment for pairwise testing and then the Bonferroni correction.

pairwise.t.test(casted_data$average_speed, casted_data$period, p.adjust.method = "none")
pairwise.t.test(casted_data$average_speed, casted_data$period, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")

## n) If the results change  in m, why do they? What does Bonferroni correction do?

# By executing multiple tests on the same sample the type 1 error rate increases 
# and we have to adjust our p-value accordingly which is what the bonferroni correction does.
# To be more precise the p-value is multiplicated by the amount of levels the factor has.
# The results change because the first post hoc test has no p-value adjustment and the second post hoc test
# uses the bonferroni correction.

### Exercise 3: 2-way ANOVA
#######################
## a) Now we want to analyze the influence of 2 categorical variables 
## (period and warning) on the speed.
## So let's turn back to our initial dataset amis (not its subset with warning==1).
## First, we need to average the speed over each `pair`, `warning` and `period
## Cast your data again and assign the results to casted_data2.

casted_data2 <- amis %>%
  group_by(pair, period, warning) %>%
  summarize(average_speed = mean(speed))

## b) State the main difference between the applicability of 1-way and 2-way ANOVA.

# The 1-way ANOVA is used with one factor that has more than 2 levels.
# The 2-way ANOVA is used with 2 factors with multiple levels.

## c) Do you think, we need to include an interaction term in the ANOVA?
###!!! vague. avoid giving generic, "rephrasing the question into an answer" type of answers:
# Yes, because we want to know if the different periods interact with the warning sign levels.

## e) Now apply the 2-way ANOVA: please use the function aov() with mean speed as the
## dependent variable, period and warning as predictor (independent) variables and depending on your
## answer in c) either including an interaction term, or not.

summary(aov(casted_data2$average_speed ~ casted_data2$period * casted_data2$warning))

## f) Report the p-values and interpret the results in detail. Properly formulate the findings
##  with regard to the research question!
###!!! again, too generic, in addition to reporting the significance
###!!! properly explain what it means for your study at hand:
# We find no significant main effect of period (F (1, 80) = 1.800, p = 0.18345)
# We find a significant main effect of warning (F (1, 80) = 8.491, p < 0.00463 < 0.01)
# There is no significant interaction between the two (F (1, 80) = 0.050, p = 0.82348).
