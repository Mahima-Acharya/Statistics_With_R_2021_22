### 1. Linear mixed model for chicken growth 
#####################################################

## a) We will first look at the dataset ChickWeight, which is already loaded in base R. Check out 
##  the help page of the data set to understand how the data was collected and look at the summary

?ChickWeight
summary(ChickWeight)

## b) Let's plot the data. We will first follow the strategy from sheet 4, i.e. 
##  1. group the data by Diet and Time and use summarise() to get the mean and se (se() as provided below)
##    of weight. Assign resulting data set to aggData
se = function(x){sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))}

aggData <- ChickWeight %>%
  group_by(Diet, Time) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(weight), se = se(weight))
aggData

##  2. Create a line plot of aggData, plotting weight on the y axis, time on the x-axis and color by Diet. 
##    Also add errorbars (mean+/-1.96*se)

ggplot(aggData, aes(x = Time, y = mean, colour = Diet)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - 1.96 * se, ymax = mean + 1.96 * se), width = 0.1)

## c) The above plot ignored that the data comes from a fixed set of chicks. Let's look at individual growth
##  by coloring by Chick instead of by Diet, but faceting by Diet (side by side). You have to use ChickWeight 
##  instead of aggData here! Also you don't need error bars, because you are not plotting the mean, but the
##  actual data

ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, colour = Chick)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(Diet))

## d) What do you observe, looking at c?

# Observing from c there is a lot of variability for the weight between different chicks.
# Diet 3 seems to be the best diet and diet 1 the worst diet to increase weight of chicks.

## e) We want to investigate whether the type of diet has an effect on the chick's growth, i.e. we are
##  looking for an interaction between time after birth and the diet type. Before running the model,
##  specify:
##  1) What fixed effect(s) do you enter into the model?

# Time and Diet
###!!! + Time:Diet

##  2) what random effect(s) should be included to account for the repeated measures structure of the data?

# Chick

##  3) In addition to random intercept(s), which random slope(s) should you add to get a maximal model?

# Time varies within chicks.
# Diet varies between chicks.
# Following from this we should add time as a random slope.

## f) Run the model you specified in e) using lmer() and assign it to chickmod

chickmod <- lmer(weight ~ Time * Diet + (1+Time|Chick), data=ChickWeight)

## g) Rerun the model leaving out the interaction between Time and Diet and assign it to chicknull

chicknull = lmer(weight ~ 1 + (1|Chick), data=ChickWeight)

## h) compare the two models using the anova() function, which performs a likelihood ratio test

anova(chickmod, chicknull)

## i) Report the p-value (from h) and the conclusion with respect to the research hypothesis

# The p-value of 2.2e-16, indicates that the difference between the two models is significant.
# With respect to the research hypothesis we can conclude that the diet influences chicks weight growth.

## j) The following code creates a plot of all chick specific intercepts and slopes. What do you see?
print(dotplot(ranef(chickmod,condVar=TRUE),  scales = list(x = list(relation = 'free')))[["Chick"]])

# For each of the 50 chicks we can see their individual intercept and their individual slope.
# There are two plots:
# The upper gives us the random slope for Time.
# The lower gives us the intercept for Chick.

###!!! too "technical", more substance expected

### 2. Random effect structures 
#####################################################

## a) Let's return to the lexdec data set and suppose, we want to look at effects of the word type of the 
## previously presented word (each subject saw a different randomized sequence) and effects of the complexity
## of the word itself, while taking into account the dependence between data points collected on the same 
## word and from the same subject. 
## Which of the following models has a maximal random effect structure given the experimental design?
## Motivate your choice.

m1 = lmer(RT ~ PrevType+ Complex+ (PrevType|Subject) + (Complex| Word), lexdec)
m2 = lmer(RT ~ PrevType+ Complex+ (PrevType+Complex|Subject) + (PrevType| Word), lexdec)
m3 = lmer(RT ~ PrevType+ Complex+ (PrevType+Complex|Subject) + (PrevType+Complex| Word), lexdec)
m4 = lmer(RT ~ PrevType+ Complex+ (Complex|Subject) + (PrevType| Word), lexdec)
m5 = lmer(RT ~ PrevType+ Complex+ (PrevType+Complex|Subject) + (1| Word), lexdec)

###!!! wrong, m2 is maximal:
# m5 has a maximal random effect structure given the experimental design.

# 1)
# PrevType varies within Subject.
# Complex varies within Subject.
# Following from this PrevType and Complex should be added as a random slope for Subject.

###!!! PrevType can vary depending on the Word:
# 2)
# Neither PrevType nor Complex vary within Word so we can't add a random slope for Word.

# The only model that fulfills the 2 conditions is m5.

## b) You want to relate students' performance in the advanced algebra course in a summer school in Saarbr??cken
##  to their final math grade in school. Performance is measured as the overall score in the final exam.
##  The summer school course has 200 participants, coming from 8 different partner Universities from all
##  over Germany. These 200 participants were randomly split into 10 tutorial groups, where each tutorial 
##  was held by a different tutor.
##  Given the design of your study, what random effects should you add to the model below?
##  Explain!!! If you want to, you can additionally add the random effects into the formula

###!!! wrong in several aspects:
## lmer(advancedalgebrascore ~ mathGrade + tutorial_group + (1|participant) + (1|university) + (1|tutor), someData)

# Fixed Effects: the tutorial group 

# We expect a difference between tutorials.

# Random Effects: the participants, the partner universities, the tutors

# Each participant is unique (can be better or worse in math) and we can't control that uniqueness.
# We don't know that much about the universities maybe some are more strict with admission if you have
# low grades in math and thus the students attending that university are better at math.
# Each tutor is unique, some may be better at explaining than others.
